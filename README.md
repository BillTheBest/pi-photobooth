# pi-photobooth

A Raspberry Pi Powered photobooth

This work is inspired by the [drumminhands_photobooth](https://github.com/drumminhands/drumminhands_photobooth) project.

## Goal

Control a DSLR (Canon Rebel T3i in my case) with a Raspberry Pi. The Pi will trigger the camera to snap pictures and then will upload them to a server that will display them and make them available for download.
